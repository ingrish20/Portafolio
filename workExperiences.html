        <p class="text- star">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
            industry's
            standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
            make
            a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
            typesetting.</p>
